     the reveal text reads as reportage. Nothing in the markup said so, so the
     narrative read as a historical account.

     The notice sits above every block of story prose, is derived from the
     thread's own fiction metadata rather than hard-coded here, and states
     plainly what is real and what is not. */

  /* Two surfaces, two palettes. The reveal panel is a dark gradient, and the

         what every thread actually asks for. */

         the hero copy sitting on bare sandstone: measured against a mid-tone
         Petra, the headline ran 3.1:1 and the stat labels 2.7:1. The photo is
         the one thing here whose pixels we do not control, so the scrim is held
         dark enough that the text does not depend on what is behind it — 0.82
         at the weak end keeps every hero ink above 4.5:1 on the brightest
         plausible stone. */

  /* Featured threads. The living mystery is drawn from its own thread
         object rather than from the static featured list, so the card can show
         live clue progress and always lands on the real thread id. */

  /* This used to read "Join 12,000+ weavers". Nothing in the catalogue backs

         field — is a different lie, because one weaver can walk several threads
         and the sum would count them repeatedly (26,190). So the aggregate is
         gone and the claim is replaced with the structural counts, which are
         derived from the catalogue by `libraryStats` and cannot drift from it. */

       difference. Every waypoint has at most one verified file, so there is
       nothing to page through and the single image carries the caption. If a
