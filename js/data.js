     NASEEJ.session — the signed-in weaver: profile, points, badges, progress.

         The Yarmouk, its basalt gorge, the migratory corridor, the columnar
         jointing and the riverside herbs are all real. The traveller, the ibex
         cut into the trail stone, the boot prints, the red thread and the herb
         wrap are not: they are invented for this thread.

         Declaring that here is what keeps this an interactive mystery rather
         than a false local history. `reveal` below is a work of fiction and the
         UI must label it as one wherever it is printed — the same reason a novel
         does not footnote its plot. */

  /* Every clue carries the interaction that earns it, so a clue is never
         "waypoint N unlocked" by position — it is unlocked by the player doing
         something. Clue 3 comes from the branch choice, which is not a waypoint
         at all. `kind` is the interaction: 'challenge' (a validated multiple
         choice answer) or 'branch' (the CHOOSE YOUR PATH decision). */

  /* KHAYT reacts to the choice itself, not only to the waypoint state. */

             a gradient) while the screen showed a multiple-choice question, so
             the brief and the interaction disagreed. `challenge` is now the

             `fieldNote` it always was. */

     dive. The card said one thing and the link opened another.

     They are now *derived*. A hand-written list may name ids only; every title,
     image, region, waypoint count and duration is read from libraryThreads /
     threadsById by id, so a card can no longer disagree with the thread it
     opens. threadSummary() returns null for an id with no thread, so an entry

     one records progress in session.completedWaypointKeys, keyed by thread id,

  /* ── ATHAR ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     One balance: NASEEJ.session.points. That is the number the profile, the
     rewards tab and the hero thread's stat row all read, so a reward can never
     land in a second, parallel purse.

     The amounts live here and nowhere else. Callers name *what* happened
     (kind) and *which* one it was (key); they never pass an amount, so there is
     no path by which a caller can invent a payout. `awarded` is the ledger:
     one entry per reward, written once, which is what makes a duplicate award
     impossible rather than merely unlikely. */

  /* What paid a reward. `type` is the kind the product pays; `source` is the
     interaction that caused it. Both are closed sets, so the security rules can
     validate them against a literal list instead of trusting a free string —
     which is the difference between "a reward row" and "whatever was posted". */

  /* Firestore document ids may not contain '/', nor be '.' or '..'. Every part

  /* ── Levels ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     The profile used to carry a hard-coded levelName / levelProgress /
     pointsToNextLevel, so earning the mystery's 500-point reveal left the level
     bar and the "N pts to next level" line describing a level the weaver was no
     longer on. Those three numbers are gone; the level is now a pure function
     of the one real balance.

     The thresholds live here and nowhere else, and a weaver can never fall
     below the level they already reached: points only ever go up, but the
     formula is defensive about it anyway. */

  /* Whole percent, 0-100. At the top level this is 100 by definition
         rather than a division by zero. */

  /* A weaver's level is read from what they have *earned*, not from what they
     are holding. Redeeming a reward spends ATHAR, and a level that dropped
     because someone spent a discount would be a bug, not a mechanic. So the
     high-water mark is remembered, and levelForWeaver() is the number the UI
     shows. The balance is still the only purse; this is a floor, not a second
     one. */

  /* Called by the one place that adds ATHAR, so the mark can never be lower
     than the balance. */

  /* ── Persistence ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     Progress is written to sessionStorage on every change and hydrated on
     boot. A signed-out demo weaver gets exactly the same treatment; the key is
     namespaced to the app, not to an account. When sessionStorage is unavailable
     (private mode, quota, sandboxed iframe) it falls back to localStorage and
     finally to memory — progress is never the reason the page fails.

     Signed-in weavers still write here (so a refresh before Firestore returns
     is not a blank slate) and js/auth.js mirrors the same snapshot to
     weavers/{uid} through setCloudWriter / accountPayload. */

  /* Touch it: Safari private mode has the object but throws on use. */

  /* last resort: per-document in-memory store, so one page's session works. */ /* quota: try the next one */

  /* ── Validation ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     Hydration reads whatever is in storage, which may be half-written, from an
     older build, or hand-edited. Every field is checked against the shape the
     app writes: a record that fails any check is dropped whole rather than
     half-applied, so a corrupt blob can never leave the mystery in a state
     that no interaction could reach. */

  /* Award amounts live in ATHAR, never in storage: whatever the blob claims,
     it is read back out of the table by key, so a tampered "amount" is
     discarded rather than credited. */

  /* The stored answer map is the record of what was *earned*, so every entry in
     it is correct by construction. A wrong attempt is deliberately not written:
     it is kept in memory only to give the same wrong option a stable reply in
     the same visit, and persisting it would have to persist "incorrect" as well,
     since a stored answer is read back as a solved waypoint. */

  /* Only solved waypoints are stored; see answersMap. */

  /* ── Lookups ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

  /* Most threads in threadsById carry no `id` field (they are keyed by it), so
     the id is resolved by reverse lookup when it is absent. Everything that
     needs to key session state by thread goes through here, so a synthetic
     stand-in object still resolves to its real thread. */

  /* Completion is unioned, never overridden: a waypoint the static data marks
     done stays done, and a future Firestore layer can only add to the set.
     Completion is monotonic, so there is no un-complete path to get wrong.

     The two representations are kept in two structures. session.completedWaypointIds
     holds bare numeric ids and is what every original thread matches on;
     session.completedWaypointKeys maps thread id -> waypoint ids and is what
     the hero thread matches on. Nothing is ever pushed into both. */

  /* ATHAR earned on a thread is derived from the ledger, so it can never drift
     from the balance: the ledger is what awardAthar writes and what hydration
     validates, and this is only ever a sum over it. */

  /* Every payout is announced by the one function that makes it, so the chips
     shown after an action are the ledger, not a hand-written guess at it. A
     clue award happens inside unlockClue and a chapter award inside
     completeHeroWaypoint; if each call site assembled its own list, those two
     would silently go unannounced while the balance moved. */

  /* A chapter is announced by its name, not by the key it is stored under:
     "Chapter 2" is meaningless, "Chapter · Follow the Person" is the thing the
     weaver just reached. 'follow' resolves through the chosen branch, which is
     why the branch must already be set when that award happens. */

  /* Chips are drained, never read: an action clears the log, does its work and
     takes whatever was paid, so a rejected attempt reports nothing. */

  /* ── Clues ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     A clue opens because an interaction succeeded, never because a waypoint
     index was reached. The condition is declared on the clue; this is the only
     function that can open one, and it is not exported — a renderer cannot ask
     for a clue, so a plain button press cannot produce one. */

  /* Only a declared clue can be opened, and only once. */

  /* ── Progress ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

  /* The reveal opens only when the whole mystery is actually solved: every
     waypoint completed, every clue earned, a path chosen. */

  /* ── Journey (My Threads) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
     session.activeThreads stays the list the profile renders; this keeps the
     hero thread's entry in step with live progress so the branch choice shows
     up there too. Written once when progress is first seen, updated after. */

  /* Solved: it stops being "in progress" and becomes a completed thread, once. */

  /* Kept on the completed card: which of the two paths this weaver finished
         is part of the record of the thread, not of the running progress. */

  /* ── Waypoint state ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     Status is derived, never stored: the same inputs (completion, order,
     branch) always produce the same status, which is what lets the renderer
     treat it as read-only and keeps a reload from desynchronising the map. */

  /* The second waypoint is where the path is chosen: it stays shut until
       the weaver picks a branch, so CHOOSE YOUR PATH is the gate rather than
       decoration. */

  /* A finished thread has no next node. This used to return waypoints[0]
       unconditionally, so a completed thread always reported an active waypoint
       and the thread page kept rendering a solid "Go to Active Node" that sent
       the visitor back to the first stop they had already finished. The
       waypoints[0] fallback is kept for the other odd case — a thread whose
       stops are all locked, where showing the first is more useful than showing
       nothing — but only when the thread is not done. */

  /* Branch overlay + live status in one read-only copy. Renderers get the
     decorated waypoint and never mutate the source data. */

  /* An interaction the weaver has already satisfied is not re-offered. */

  /* ── Chapters, branch, KHAYT ─────────────────────────────────────────────── */

  /* Connection is a milestone (waypoint 4 / clue 4), not "three clues".
       A branch plus an observation unlocks clue 3 and must still show the
       branch chapter until that milestone is actually completed. */

  /* The choice is offered once the first clue is earned — that is what the
         trail head's ibex mark is for. */

  /* ── KHAYT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     KHAYT is a story companion, not a chatbot and not a language model. Every
     line it says is written in this file, keyed to the thread, the waypoint, the
     chapter, the branch and the answer the weaver just gave — so it is a
     narrator with opinions about the plot, not a general-purpose assistant.

     The three calls are the whole interface, and they are deliberately
     provider-shaped so a real model can be dropped in later without the UI
     changing:

       khaytAI.ask(context)      a line of dialogue for this moment
       khaytAI.getHint(context)  a nudge, given sparingly and never the answer
       khaytAI.react(context)    a reaction to what the weaver just did

     `provider` is 'local'. There is no network call, no API key and no model
     here, and the UI says so rather than implying a live AI is connected. A
     future Gemini/Claude adapter implements the same three functions; nothing in
     pages.js or navigation.js has to change, because neither of them knows how
     the words are produced. */

  /* A nudge, never the answer. It says what kind of thing to look for; the
       weaver still has to choose. */

  /* What KHAYT says in response to the weaver's last action. */

  /* ── Interactions ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     Both interactions answer the same shape of question, so one validated path
     covers them: pick an option, submit it, get the truth of it. A wrong answer
     changes nothing and can be retried; a right one is recorded once and pays
     once. */

  /* One attempt, one chip log. */

  /* Solved already: the panel hides Validate, so reaching this means a direct
       call. Report it the way the other duplicate paths do rather than as a bare
       status, so a caller cannot mistake it for a refusal. */

  /* Already solved: re-submitting the right answer is a duplicate, not a
         second payout, and re-submitting a wrong one is refused outright. */

  /* Wrong answers change nothing durable: no completion, no clue, no ATHAR,
         and nothing written that a reload could read back as progress. The same
         question stays open so it can be answered again. Only the option just
         tried is remembered, and only for this visit, so a repeat gets a reply
         that names it instead of the generic one. */

  /* Order is the order the weaver experiences: the answer pays, the clue it
       earned pays, the chapter it reached pays, and if that was the last piece
       the ending pays. Each of those awards logs itself (see awardAthar), so
       this list is complete by construction. */

  /* Last waypoint solved is the only moment the reveal can open: before this
       the "everything solved" test is false, and the branch is chosen long
       before the last clue. Called here so the ending and its ATHAR arrive with
       the answer that earned them. */

  /* Kept as the two named entry points the renderers use; both go through the
     same validated path. */

  /* A path is chosen once. Re-submitting returns what was already chosen
       rather than switching branches or paying twice. */

  /* The choice is itself a solved interaction: it opens the third clue. */

  /* Opening the next chapter is its own reward, keyed on the chapter. */

  /* ── Final reveal ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     Assembled from what the weaver actually did, in the order they did it, and
     ending on the text for the branch they chose. The renderer prints it; it
     does not compose it, so the two branches cannot drift apart.
     Gated on the reveal flag, not just on the content existing: this is the one
     function that can return the ending, so until the thread is solved it
     answers null and no renderer — or caller holding this namespace — can read
     the story, the clue texts or the chapter names early. */

  /* Live stat row for the hero thread, in the same shape as the static `stats`
     the other threads carry, so the thread renderer stays one renderer. */

  /* ── Persistence entry points ────────────────────────────────────────────── */

  /* Called once at boot, before the first route renders. Anything that fails
     validation is dropped silently — a bad blob must never stop the site from
     starting — and the demo balance is kept when no valid one was stored. */

  /* The peak can never be below the balance, whatever the file claims, and it
       can never fall either — a weaver who spent ATHAR keeps their level. */

  /* ── Public content API ──────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

  /* Returns the requested thread, or the default thread when the id is
       null/unknown. Returns null only when the data itself is broken. */

  /* Whether an id names a real thread — the router uses it to tell a typo
       from a deliberate fallback. */

  /* The read-only view of a waypoint a renderer should use: branch overlay
       applied and live status derived. Always called with the REAL thread. */

  /* The validated question for a waypoint, or null when there is none to ask
       (already answered, or still locked). */

  /* Level is derived from the balance, never stored. The thresholds are the
       only place a level number is defined. */

  /* Wishlist, sharing, maps and demo redemption — all local-first, all behind
       a function the UI can call without knowing where the state lives. */

  /* The normalised cloud model. Read by js/firebase.js's writer, written by
       its reader — data.js keeps the transport out of this file entirely. */

  /* The waypoint a waypoint route should show: the requested one, else the
       thread's active waypoint, else its first. */

  /* How far through a thread the weaver is, as a percentage. Firestore's
       figure wins once it exists; the static one is the fallback. */

  /* ── Photography ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       There is no verified photograph of every waypoint in this build. The
       previous content filled every card with an Unsplash hit chosen for
       plausibility, which made a generic landscape read as "this is what the
       place looks like". That is the misattribution this replaces.

       What is real, under assets/places/: thirty-two files are photographs of
       the exact place their filename names, and eighty are SVG illustrations
       drawn for the exact stop. data marks which is which with
       `imageStatus: "placeholder"` on the illustration, and the media layer
       captions it as an illustration rather than as a photograph — a caption
       claiming otherwise would be the same lie in a smaller font.

       A thread may also show its city's photograph, and the caption says so —
       that is a truthful statement about a place the thread is in, not a claim
       about the waypoint. Every source returns `kind`, which is what lets the
       renderer say which of the three it is showing; returning an illustration
       and letting a caption call it a photograph is the failure mode here. */

  /* imageSubject is the place the file depicts — for a thread cover wired
         from its first stop, that stop rather than the thread title. */

  /* Only a local file on that waypoint. Never a city or thread photograph
       presented as the stop itself, and never an illustration relabelled as a
       photograph: imageStatus decides `kind`, and the caption follows it. */

  /* Library filter, ported from ThreadsLibrary.tsx `match`. */

  /* How many library threads carry each category. Static content, so the
       sidebar counts are computed once instead of on every keystroke. */

  /* ── Session API (the signed-in weaver) ─────────────────────────────────────

     These are the values Firestore will own once Firebase is enabled: the
     profile document, the points balance, the badges earned, the waypoints
     already completed and the per-thread progress. They are hard-coded for
     now, exactly as they were in UserProfile.tsx, and are read through
     NASEEJ.session so no renderer has to know where they came from. */

  /* A signed-out visitor is a demo weaver, and is labelled as one: the
         previous "Layla Hassan / Verified / Amman" read as a real account with a
         real history. js/auth.js replaces these fields with the Google account's
         name and photo only after a real sign-in, and restores them on sign-out. */

  /* THE ATHAR BALANCE. One number, one owner: every reward the mystery pays
       adds to this, and the profile, the rewards tab and the thread stat row
       all read it back. Nothing else keeps a parallel purse.

       There is deliberately no levelName / levelProgress / pointsToNextLevel
       here. Those were static numbers that stopped being true the moment the
       weaver earned anything; use data.levelFor(session.points) instead, which
       is the only thing that decides a level. */

  /* Highest balance the weaver has ever held. Level is read from this, so

  /* Waypoint ids already completed, and per-thread progress percentages.

       filling these two in is the only change needed to make the whole site
       read live Firestore progress.

       completedWaypointIds is the original model: bare numeric waypoint ids,
       matched against any thread. completedWaypointKeys is the same idea keyed
       by thread (thread id -> waypoint ids) and is what the living-mystery
       thread uses. The two are deliberately separate arrays: one list of
       numbers and one map of lists can never be confused for each other. */

  /* ── Small local stores ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
     The wishlist and the redemption log are separate documents rather than
     more fields on the progress snapshot. Two reasons: a corrupt wishlist must
     not cost a weaver their mystery progress, and each is a shape Firestore can
     take over one at a time. Each store validates on the way in, so a
     hand-edited blob contributes nothing rather than something wrong. */ /* quota: try the next one */

  /* Only ids that name a real thread are kept, so a wishlist entry can never
     point at something the UI would have to render as a missing thread. */

  /* A stored claim is only believed when it names a real reward and carries a
     non-negative cost that matches that reward's current price. */

  /* ── Account mirror ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     auth.js is the only caller. data.js still does not touch the network: it
     just hands a validated snapshot to a writer auth.js registered, and applies
     one that writer loaded. Unsigned visitors never register a writer, so they
     keep the local demo/seeded behaviour. */

  /* ── Normalised cloud model ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
     The snapshot above is one document, which is the right shape for one
     browser. Firestore wants the same facts as documents a query can address,
     because the reward ledger only works if a reward is a *row keyed by a
     deterministic id*: a second grant for the same (thread, waypoint, kind)
     becomes literally the same document rather than a second row to reconcile
     afterwards.

     Export is derived entirely from state that already exists — `awarded` is
     the authority for what has been paid, and the amounts come out of the ATHAR
     table — so exporting cannot invent a payout. Import is the only place a
     remote value can enter, and it merges rather than replaces: progress
     unions, ATHAR only ever grows, and a row that does not name something the
     product actually has is discarded rather than believed.

     This section reads and writes NASEEJ.session and nothing else. It has no
     network access, which is what keeps it testable in Node and keeps data.js
     a pure domain layer; js/firebase.js owns the transport and js/auth.js
     decides when to call either side. */

  /* t{threadId}_{kind}_{key} — the whole point of the model. Waypoint ids are
     numbered 1..n per thread, so the thread id has to be in the key: 'challenge
     waypoint 2' in two threads is two different rewards, and without the thread
     one of them would be silently swallowed. */

  /* The clue a reward was earned by. Clues declare the interaction that opens
     them and only that interaction can, so this is declared data rather than a
     guess. Chapter awards name the waypoint that carries the chapter. */

  /* One ledger entry -> one reward row, or null when the entry does not
     describe a reward the product pays. `amount` is read from the ATHAR table
     and never from the map: what `awarded` stores is a marker that this was
     granted, not a price. */

  /* Every reward this weaver holds, as rows ready to write. Sorted so two
     exports of the same state are byte-identical, which is what lets a caller
     diff a local bundle against a cloud one instead of guessing. */

  /* Only a claim whose cost matches the reward's current price counts, the
         same check cleanRedemptions applies on the way in. */

  /* ── Progress rows ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     One row per completed waypoint plus one per thread, because "which stop did
     I finish" and "how far through the thread am I" are different questions and
     the profile renders both. */

  /* A key naming a waypoint that is not in its thread would let a remote
           document invent progress on content the product does not have. */

  /* Bare ids are not thread-scoped — they match a waypoint id in any thread.
       Attaching one to every thread that has a waypoint with that id is the
       only honest reading, and it is why this set is normally empty: only the
       living-mystery thread writes completed progress. */

  /* Only solved interactions are exported. A wrong answer is deliberately
         kept in memory and never persisted, so there is nothing to carry. */

  /* The whole cloud model for the current weaver. `athar` is the total ever
     earned (a ledger sum), never the held balance: the balance can fall when a
     reward is redeemed, and the security rules require this figure to be
     monotonic. `atharBase` is the balance a weaver already held before this
     build existed — the demo weaver starts with one — and it is written once,
     at migration, which is the only reason it exists at all. */

  /* What the weaver held before this build paid anything: the balance, plus
       whatever has since been spent back out of it, minus the ledger. Spending
       has to be added back here, or redeeming a reward would quietly shrink the
       base and the balance would not come back to where it started. */

  /* ── Import ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     Merges a cloud bundle into the session. Nothing here replaces local state
     with remote state: completion unions, a mystery takes the union of its
     solved interactions, and the balance comes from the ledger so a stale
     `points` field can never lower a real total.

     Every incoming reward is rebuilt through buildRewardRow, which checks the
     kind, the amount and the thread/waypoint/clue against the product data.
     That is what stops a hand-written document from becoming ATHAR: the shape
     has to name a reward this build actually pays. */

  /* The document id is the uniqueKey, so a document that disagrees with its
         own path is not one this client wrote. */

  /* Writing a ledger back into session.mystery, one entry per reward, through
     the same map awardAthar() uses — so a remote award and a local one are the
     same state, not two shapes of the same thing. */

  /* A completed waypoint must exist in the thread it claims to belong to.
           Without this a single document could complete anything. */

  /* A path is chosen once. A document cannot switch it. */

  /* reveal is never taken from a document: it is recomputed by maybeReveal()
         from the state above, which is the only thing that can open it. That is
         what stops a single hand-written document from reading the ending, and
         it is also what reopens it on a second device — the ledger already
         carries the reveal reward, so the recomputation pays nothing twice. */

  /* Apply a cloud bundle. Returns what the merge added, so the caller can push
     the new rows back rather than guessing which ones Firestore was missing.
     Never lowers a balance: the merged ledger plus what has been spent is a
     floor, and any locally-held excess is kept on top. */

  /* The balance is derived, never copied: the ledger is what was paid, the
         claim log is what was spent, and the base is what a weaver held before
         any of it. The base is the larger of the cloud's and the local one —
         it is written once, at migration, so a higher local figure means this
         browser has something the account has never seen, not that the account
         lost anything. */

  /* The legacy single-document shape is still produced: an account that has
         not migrated yet, or a Firestore outage, must not depend on the new
         model being readable. */

  /* ── Wishlist ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     A real, working feature with a deliberately small surface: toggle a thread,
     read the set, count it. It is stored locally exactly like progress, and it
     is keyed by thread id so swapping the storage for a `weavers/{uid}/wishlist`
     document is a change of two functions, not of the UI. The renderer only
     ever asks isWishlisted / toggleWishlist; it never touches storage. */

  /* ── Sharing ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     The payload is built here so the copy is written once, and so the title
     that is shared can never drift from the thread the page is showing. It
     carries the route rather than an absolute URL: data.js does not touch the
     DOM, so the caller supplies location and prefixes the hash. */

  /* ── Maps ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     A waypoint only gets a maps link when it has real coordinates. Inventing
     them for the sake of a button would put a pin in the wrong place, so a
     waypoint without coordinates gets no button at all — see media() in
     pages.js, which applies the same rule to photography. */

  /* Both providers are addressed by the same coordinate pair; which one the
     user gets is the browser's choice, and neither is a fabricated location. */

  /* ── Reward redemption ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     There is no partner integration, so this does not pretend to be one. It
     spends real ATHAR out of the one balance, records the claim locally so it
     cannot be claimed twice, and returns a status the UI states plainly as a
     demo. `partner` is the thing a real redemption would need to prove, and it
     is null on purpose: nothing here contacts a partner. */

  /* Guard the direction of the check: a reward can never be claimed for a
       negative or missing cost, and can never be claimed for more ATHAR than
       the weaver holds. */

  /* Both stores are written. saveProgress() is what persists the reduced
       balance, and it is a separate key from the claim log: without it the
       ATHAR comes straight back on the next hydrate while the reward still
       reads as claimed, so the weaver gets it twice. */

  /* Reward ids are slugs ('ajloun-soap'), not numbers, so they are compared
       as strings. A numeric caller still resolves. */

  /* Keep the registry usable when a different namespace already exists. */
